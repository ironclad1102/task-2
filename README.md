Task 2: Data Visualization and Storytelling

Data Preparation: I started by importing the supermarket sales data into Power BI, possibly using Power Query. I cleaned and transformed the data, ensuring columns like Gross Income, Quantity, COGS, Unit Price, Tax %, Rating, Customer Type, Payment, Branch, Product Line, and Gender were properly formatted and free of errors.

Data Model Setup: I organized the data into a model, likely creating relationships between tables if I used multiple sources. I ensured the data was structured to support calculations and filters, such as linking Branch to City for regional analysis.

Creating Key Metrics: I added calculated measures using DAX to derive key figures. For example, I calculated the Sum of Gross Income (15.38K), Average Quantity (5.51), Total COGS (307.59K), Maximum Unit Price (99.96), and Average Unit Price (55.67) as card visuals to provide a quick overview.

Building Visuals:
Bar Chart: I created a bar chart to compare the Sum of Gross Income and Average Rating by City (Naypyitaw, Yangon, Mandalay), using filters to focus on specific branches.
Gauge Chart: I added a gauge chart to display the Average Rating (6.97) and another to show Average Gross Income (15.38), setting appropriate target values for context.
Table Visualization: I built a table to detail City, Product Line, Sum of Tax %, Sum of Quantity, Sum of Rating, and Sum of Unit Price, summarizing data across all branches.
Applying Filters: I incorporated slicers for Customer Type, Payment, Branch, Product Line, and Gender, allowing interactive filtering. For instance, I could select "Member" or "Cash" to refine the data displayed.

Formatting and Styling: I used the Format section of the Visualizations pane to adjust colors, labels, and titles, ensuring a consistent look. I likely applied a theme to match the supermarket branding and added alt text for accessibility, as I’ve shown interest in this before.

Layout and Organization: I arranged the visuals on the canvas, grouping metrics like Gross Income and Average Quantity together, and placed the table below for detailed insights. I added the Supermarket logo and title for a professional touch.

Testing and Refinement: I tested the dashboard with different filter combinations to ensure accuracy and performance, optimizing it for large datasets as I’ve explored before, possibly using data summarization or filtering techniques.
